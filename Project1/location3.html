      <h2>Iceland</h2>
      Population: about 323,000 people<br>
      Currency: Icelandic kr√≥na<br>
      Largest City: Reykjavik<br>
      Official Language: Icelandic<br>
      <br>
      Iceland is like the cold version of Hawaii. Lots of lava rocks, volcanoes, waterfalls, and many other natural phenomenon. The country is a small island where many of its goods are imported and therefore placed at higher prices. Hours of darkness are very minimal in the summer &amp; hours of lightness are very minimal in the winter. In addition to many other types of fish, shark is a popular exotic food they serve in many restaurants. Another popular food is Skyr. It's like a healthier version of Greek yogurt, having little to no fat content and very high protein. Iceland has a large amount of drinking glacial water that is among the freshest in the world. Popular attractions include: the northern lights, whale watching, geothermal spas, excursions and tours to natural wonders. <br><br>
