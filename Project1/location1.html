      <h2>Dublin, Ireland</h2>
      Home of the original Guinness Storehouse, divided from Europe by the Irish Sea, and revolving around The River Liffey. Ireland is an old European island. They are very cultured, as their nation is much older than the USA. Their currency is the euro, but in Northern Ireland it's the pound. Northern Ireland is not a part of the Irish council and is considered part of the United Kingdom. Ireland's national language is Irish (though English is also an official language of the country), and their idea of chips, crisps, and cookies have an entirely different from they would be in the USA. Some of the Irish lingo I noticed was: lift-elevator, gaff-home, queue-line, cheers-thanks, grand-great, class-awesome/good, and where Americans sometimes say "I have 5 bucks", in reference to money, they will say in regards to some euro: "I have 5 quid". Standard Irish salad uses a base of arugula rather than the American standard of lettuce. The city of Dublin is filled with pubs. Many people use the bus as their mode of transportation. Cars and roadways are backwards from the USA. Rugby, hurling, and soccer are very popular sports though out the nation. The Irish use the metric system. "Summer" rarely gets to or beyond 80&deg;F, or 27&deg;C.
