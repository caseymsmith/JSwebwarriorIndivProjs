      <h2>Iceland</h2>
      Currency: Icelandic króna<br>
      Official Language: Icelandic<br>
      <br>
      Iceland is the cold version of Hawaii. Lots of lava rocks, volcanoes, waterfalls, and many other natural phenomenon. The country is a small island with a population of about 323,000 people, the majority of the population residing in the city Reykjavik. Many of the island's goods are imported and therefore placed at higher prices. Hours of darkness are very minimal in the summer &amp; hours of lightness are very minimal in the winter. In addition to many other types of fish, shark is a popular exotic food they serve in many restaurants. Another popular food is Skyr. It's a healthier version of Greek yogurt, having little to no fat content and very high protein. Iceland has a large amount of drinking glacial water that is among the freshest in the world. Popular attractions include: the northern lights, whale watching, geothermal spas, excursions and tours to natural wonders. <br><br>
