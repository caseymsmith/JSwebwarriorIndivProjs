For this project iteration, use the Hands-On Project 2-4 as a template for creating an "order" page for your website.  At a minimum you should have 4 products with individual prices (as an alternative, you could have a range of prices for a single project that has variations, such as Small, Medium, Large, Extra-Large).

The user should be able to make multiple selections and click a submit button.  Calculate a subtotal, sales tax (6%) and total amount due for the order.  The calculated totals can appear in an alert box, or you can display them directly on your webpage.

As always, your calculations and modifications should be documented in your project with meaningful comments.
