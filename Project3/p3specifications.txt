This iteration of the Individual Project has 2 parts:

1. Using the Hands-On Project 3-3View in a new window as a template, modify your individual project to create and populate an array of products. Create a function that dynamically adds the array values to your products page (essentially replacing the static list you created in the Chapter 2 assignment).  

2. Using Hands-On Project 3-1 as a template, change the mechanism for calculating the subtotal of a customer order to incorporate a for loop.
