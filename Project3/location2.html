      <h2>Zakynthos, Greece</h2>
      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
      This Greek island is known as Zakynthos, or Zante. The island was once an Italian island, and Zante is the Italian name for it. Zakynthos is it's Greek name. It is the 3rd largest island of the Ionion and has a port on the East side of the island. There is one airport on the island. Private cars, ATVs, and bus are common means of transportation. It is not uncommon to meet an Albanian person in Zakynthos, as Albania borders Greece very closely and many of the people from Albania like to come to Greece for work and the beaches. Greece uses the euro as their form of currency and their largest city is Athens. Zakynthos is popular for attractions including: Shipwreck Bay/Navagio Beach, Keri Caves, Blue Caves, Turtle Island, Laganas, Cameo Island Porto Limnionas beach, Xygia Sulfur beach, and more. The surrounding ocean has many sea turtles roaming the vibrant clear blue coast. There is a variety of exotic fruit growing on the island due to continuous high temperatures. Street signs read in Greek, as it is the official language, though English is widely spoken across the island. Greek salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, onlive oil, getta cheese, and oregano), fish, lamb, pork, chicken, and gyros are common cuisine on the island, along with some Italian dishes.
